                <p>"1984" by George Orwell is a dystopian novel that explores the terrifying effects of totalitarianism on society and the individual. The story follows Winston Smith, who lives under the oppressive rule of the Party and its leader, Big Brother. Through surveillance, propaganda, and brutal enforcement, the Party seeks to control not just the actions but also the thoughts of its citizens.</p>
                <p>The novel's logical fallacies illustrate the manipulative tactics used by the Party to maintain power. The false dichotomy presented by the Party forces citizens to choose between complete submission or severe punishment, creating a sense of hopeless inevitability. The appeal to fear ensures compliance, as people are too terrified of the consequences of dissent. Finally, the use of ad hominem attacks discredits and dehumanizes opponents, making any opposition seem illegitimate.</p>
                <p>Orwell's use of language and quotes throughout the book highlights the extent of the Party's control and the erosion of truth. Phrases like "War is peace" and "Freedom is slavery" epitomize the concept of doublethink - “The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them"(Orwell) - demonstrating the Party's power to manipulate reality. The quote, "Big Brother is watching you," serves as a constant reminder of the pervasive surveillance state, instilling a sense of paranoia and fear.</p>
                <p>In "1984," Orwell not only warns about the dangers of totalitarianism but also critiques the susceptibility of societies to such regimes. The novel remains relevant today as a powerful reminder of the importance of vigilance and resistance in the face of oppression.</p>

                <p>“It is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely”(Machiavelli 2)</p>
                <p>Totalitarianism countries take the same "fear" approach as Machiavelli's "The Prince". This can especially be seen in 1984 through Big Brother and the Party when the Party uses fear to control its citizens.</p>
