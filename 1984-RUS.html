                    <h1>Never-ending War</h1>
                    <p>In 1984, there is a never-ending war between Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. However, the never-ending war comes with a purpose - for the ruling class to remain in power. This is shown when Orwell writes, “A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense-- is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.”(Orwell 218)</p>
                    <p>These elements can especially be seen through the Russo-Ukrainian War. If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ceases to exist. Both countries continue to fight with a purpose. One country fights for power while the other fights for protection (Kendall-Taylor and Frantz).</p>
                 </section>
                 <section id="free-speech">
                    <h1>Free Speech</h1>
                    <p>“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows”(Orwell 90). The citizens of Oceania do not have this freedom. They must comply with whatever Big Brother says, no matter how wrong, in order to survive.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, this is shown through the Russian government. In Russia, Putin enacted a law to punish anybody that spreads “false information” about the Ukraine war. Punishment can mean up to 15 years in prison (Kolesnikov). This means that, regardless of its correctness, citizens are restricted from making statements that don't align with the Russian government.</p>

                 <section id="gov-conformity">
                    <h1>Government Conformity</h1>
                    <p>In order to get by in Oceania, the citizens must grow to "love Big Brother", complying with government rule. This is shown through O'Brien, an Inner Party member, when Orwell writes, “You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him; you must love him.” (Orwell 309)</p>
                    <p>In Russia, Putin restricts and punishes those who fail to conform to Russian government ideals (Kovalev). As a result, citizens are forced to comply through fear of facing harsh punishment.</p>

                 <section id="oppression">
                    <h1>Oppression</h1>
                    <p>In 1984, the government tortures those who fail to comply with government rule by using their worst fears against them. This is shown when Orwell writes through O'Brien, “ ”The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.[...] “In your case,” said O’Brien, “the worst thing in the world happens to be rats.” ”(Orwell 310). By torturing those who fail to comply, the government makes a statement that encourages others citizens to conform to Big Brother. In addition, this fear encourages citizens to use crimestop - the act of stopping short at the threshold of a dangerous thought.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, this is also seen through the Russian government today. Russia instills fear in its citizens by punishing those who fight against government ideals. This fear encourages citizens to comply(Courtney and Wasielewski).</p>
