                    <h1>Government Conformity</h1>
                    <p>On 1944, George Orwell, the author of 1984 wrote a letter that revealed his purpose behind writing 1984. In this letter, Orwell talked about English intelligentsia and its political maneuvers and mannerisms post World War II.</p>
                    <p>The mannerisms of English intelligentsia are shown through the letter when Orwell writes, “On the whole the English intelligentsia have opposed Hitler, but only at the price of accepting Stalin. Most of them are perfectly ready for dictatorial methods, secret police, systematic falsification of history etc. so long as they feel that it is on ‘our’ side.”(Orwell 2)</p>
                    <p>Today, these same ideas are considered in US politics. Citizens are willing to accept change as long as it feels as if the change is in "their favor".</p>

                 <section id="free-speech">
                    <h1>Free Speech</h1>
                    <p>Although free speech is legally advocated for in the US through the First Amendment, citizens are still being silenced through fear. Free speech is threatened by media through Cancel Culture. The fear of being "cancelled" prevents citizens from expressing their own opinions online. Attached below is a video that sheds light on this problem:</p>

                 <section id="privacy">
                    <h1>Privacy/Surveillance</h1>
                    <p>In 1984, privacy is severely minimal, as the Party spies on the citizens of Oceania through mass surveillance programs.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, this lack of privacy can also be seen in the United States today. "Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act permits the U.S. government to engage in mass, warrantless surveillance of Americans’ international communications, including phone calls, texts, emails, social media messages, and web browsing"(Taitz 2). Although the US government doesn't resort to harsh punishment for expressing individual opinions - as shown in 1984 - mass surveillance is still a big issue that puts American citizens' privacy at stake.</p>
