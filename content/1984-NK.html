                    <h1>Revising History</h1>
                    <p>In 1984, Party members had the task of revising history to align with the ideals of the present or the future. This is shown through the main character, Winston Smith, when Orwell writes, “Winston’s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones.”(Orwell 44)</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we can see these same events play out in the North Korean government. On January 6, 2014, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un removed and revised historical facts regarding his uncle Jang Song Thaek online and from North Korean history textbooks after his execution(Lankov).</p>

                    <h1>Propaganda</h1>
                    <p>In 1984, the Party successfully convinces the citizens of Oceania that they had always been at war with Eastasia through propaganda. This is made possible by teaching its citizens blackwhite - the ability to accept whatever "truth" the Party puts out, regardless of its absurdity. This is shown when Orwell writes, “Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But there was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.”(Orwell 38)</p>
                    <p>In North Korea, propaganda is widely being used to portray North Korea in a more positive light. All social media platforms in North Korea are controlled and monitored by the government. The news reporters carry reports that idolize and flatter the North Korean government and economic/political issues are rarely reported(BBC News).</p>
                    <p>Attached below is a video that shows the North Korean government's propaganda in action:</p>

                    <h1>Free Speech</h1>
                    <p>Speech is incredibly limited in 1984. Citizens who make statements that do not align with Big Brother's ideals are guaranteed to face harsh punishment, or even death - regardless of whether or not their statement is morally or logically correct. As a result, citizens are forced to believe that virtually everything Big Brother says is "correct". Even 2 + 2 = 5.</p>
                    <p>We can see these same restrictions being held in North Korea. In North Korea, “Fear of collective punishment is used to silence dissent” (Human Rights Watch 3). Consequently, citizens are prevented from expressing their own opinions.</p>

                    <h1>Privacy/Surveillance</h1>
                    <p>In order to monitor the citizens of Oceania, the Party utilizes the telescreen to observe their physical and verbal actions. This is shown when Orwell writes, “Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.”(Orwell 5)</p>
                    <p>In comparison, North Korea uses mass surveillance programs to spy on its citizens. Attached below is a video that shows this surveillance in action:</p>
